# 🧠 Brain Simulator

### A virtual brain that remembers experiences, develops emotions, and changes its behavior over time.

Most AI systems answer questions.
**Brain Simulator lives a life.**

It does not reset after every interaction.
How you treat it — praise, neglect, criticism — changes its future decisions, confidence, and personality.

---

## 🚀 What You’ll Notice Immediately

Talk to the agent repeatedly and its behavior will evolve:

* Repeated praise → confidence increases
* Repeated criticism → cautious or avoidant behavior
* Mixed experiences → reflection and wisdom formation
* Stressful periods → recovery and resilience

You are not just giving input.
You are shaping a developing cognitive identity.

## 🧪 See It In Action (Behavior Example)

```
[STEP 10] User praises the agent
Dopamine: 58 → 66
Oxytocin: 60 → 65
Memory formed: "I was appreciated"

Effect:
The agent becomes more socially proactive.

[STEP 25] User criticizes the agent
Cortisol: 40 → 50
Dopamine: 66 → 62
Memory linked to earlier praise

Effect:
The agent hesitates before taking risks.

[STEP 26] Self-reflection triggered
Regret calculated
Wisdom: 0.00 → 0.02

Effect:
Future decisions become more careful and strategic.
```

The important part is **not the numbers** —
the important part is that *past experiences affect future behavior*.

## 🤖 Why This Is Different From Chatbots

| Chatbots / LLM Agents          | Brain Simulator                   |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| Stateless responses            | Persistent internal state         |
| Context window memory          | Emotional autobiographical memory |
| Same personality every session | Personality evolves over time     |
| Predicts text                  | Simulates cognition               |
| Reacts                         | Learns from experience            |

Brain Simulator acts as a **cognitive layer** that can sit between a user and an AI model, giving the agent emotional continuity and identity.

### Internal Processes

* Neurochemical system (dopamine, cortisol, oxytocin, serotonin)
* Event-based autobiographical memory
* Identity trait development
* Strategic future simulation
* Reflection and regret learning

Each time step (“tick”) represents a moment of cognition.

## 🎮 Try This First (Important)

After starting live mode:

1. Praise it several times
2. Then criticize it repeatedly
3. Then ask it to make a decision or take an action

You will observe:

* hesitation
* recovery
* adaptation

You are essentially running a **psychology experiment on an artificial mind**.

## 🛠 Installation

### Requirements

* Python 3.8+
* 4GB RAM minimum (8GB recommended)

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Gabrial-8467/Brain-Simulator.git
cd Brain-Simulator

python -m venv brain_env
source brain_env/bin/activate
# Windows:
# brain_env\Scripts\activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## ▶ Running the Simulation

### Standard Simulation

```
python main.py --cycles 100
```

### Interactive Mode (recommended)

```
python main.py --mode live
```

### Deterministic Testing

```
python main.py --cycles 500 --deterministic
```

## 🧠 What the System Simulates

### 1) Experience

Neurochemicals respond to events:

* Dopamine → reward & motivation
* Cortisol → stress & threat
* Oxytocin → social bonding
* Serotonin → stability & mood

### 2) Memory

The system stores events with emotional signatures and retrieves them later through associative similarity.

### 3) Behavior

Repeated experiences modify:

* confidence
* resilience
* decision style
* social strategy

## 🧬 Emergent Properties

From simple rules, complex behavior appears:

* confidence building
* avoidance learning
* burnout & recovery
* regret-based wisdom
* strategic planning

No single module is “hardcoded” to produce these — they arise naturally from the system.

## 📖 What Happens Over Long Use?

Over many sessions the agent:

* develops preferences
* adapts interaction style
* remembers repeated treatment
* changes risk-taking behavior
* forms a stable identity pattern

It becomes less like a program and more like a **consistent character**.
